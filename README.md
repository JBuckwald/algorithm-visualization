# Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool designed to visualize classic sorting algorithms. This project provides a step-by-step breakdown of how algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort operate, helping users understand the underlying mechanics of these foundational computer science concepts.

## About The Project

This project was built to create a clear and intuitive learning experience for students and developers. Many data structures and algorithms courses teach the theory, but it can be difficult to picture what the "whiteboard" version of an algorithm actually looks like. This tool bridges that gap by animating the process one step at a time.

Each algorithm visualization is paired with a simple Python pseudocode implementation that highlights the currently executing line of code, connecting the abstract logic to the concrete visual changes.

## Features

* **Interactive Visualizations:** Watch algorithms sort an array of integers in real-time.
* **Step-by-Step Controls:** Play, pause, and step forward or backward through the algorithm's execution to understand every comparison and swap.
* **Code Highlighting:** A collapsible side panel shows a Python implementation of the algorithm, with the active line of code highlighted at each step.
* **Recursive Visualization:** For complex algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort, the visualizer shows the recursive calls by creating new sub-arrays on different levels, making the "divide and conquer" strategy easy to follow.
* **Responsive Design:** The interface is built to be clean and usable on a variety of screen sizes.

## Technology Stack

This project was built using modern web technologies:

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **D3.js:** The core data visualization library used to draw and animate the nodes.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building the user interface.
* **GitHub Pages:** For hosting the live version of the project.
